### Method of Extreme points

##### This here is an implementation of the optimization solving algorithm based on the simplex algorithm in what is called here as "Method of Extreme points"
##### this has been implemented as an application where the calculation is done on the backend and the visualization is on the front end

##### for 2Variable problem it is possible to see the graph of the solution.
